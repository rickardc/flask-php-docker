## Simple ML API Containerized with Docker

This is a simple ML API that predicts the price of a house in Melbourne based on the number of rooms and distance from the city center. The API is called from a PHP container, converting the input data to JSON and sending it to the ML API. The ML API then returns the predicted price, which is then displayed on the PHP page.
